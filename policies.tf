# ACCESS POLICY
#
# This example access policy gives everyone in the "Engineering" GitHub team
# read access to the stack.

# PLAN POLICY
#
# This example plan policy prevents you from creating weak passwords, and warns 
# you when passwords are meh.

# PUSH POLICY
#
# This example Git push policy ignores all changes that are outside a project's
# root. Other than that, it follows the defaults - pushes to the tracked branch
# trigger tracked runs, pushes to all other branches trigger proposed runs, tag
# pushes are ignored.

# TRIGGER POLICY
#
# This example trigger policy will cause every stack that declares dependency on
# the current one to get triggered the current one is successfully updated.

# LOGIN POLICY
#
# This example login policy gives everyone in the GitHub organization access to
# Spacelift and makes all members of the GitHub "DevOps" team admins.
